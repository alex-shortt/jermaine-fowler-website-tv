      "The subject is almost sheepish about his own accomplishments, preferring to chalk his success up to his honest nature and the kind words of a stranger after his first open mic. His truth-telling has made him a hit on shows like Guy Code. However, his tenacity shines through in his refusal to be ignored—he recognizes his unique talents, and he refuses to settle for “class clown.” When pressed about his motivations for revealing personal details for comedic effect, he likens the act to therapy; censorship is the enemy for today’s guest, and his veracity has paid off in the form of a development deal with CBS and a new standup special on Showtime, Give ‘Em Hell, Kid. Jermaine Fowler‘s affability is undeniable, but his standup sticks with you because of the singularity in his comedic voice."
